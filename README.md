# The simplest role is to use one card to attack enemy’s card or home, once one player’s home is destoryed, it loose. 
# Some card has special skills . For example, some card can reborn some destoried card, some can sommon basic card and some can change basic card’s attack and defance and even give them special skills. 
# Those card with special feature use magic, and magic is limited, so player should use those card carefully.
